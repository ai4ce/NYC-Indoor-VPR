                <p>Our dataset is named NYC-Indoor-VPR. It is composed of images recorded in New York City from April 2022 to April 2023. Footage was captured using hand-held Insta360 one x2 spherical cameras,  generating videos with a resolution of 1920x960. On the basis of raw images, we use <a href="https://github.com/mseg-dataset/mseg-api" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(190, 80, 190);">MSeg</a>, a semantic segmentation method, to replace moving objects such as people and cars with white pixels. Fig. 1 compares anonymized and raw images.</p>

                </div>

                <p> We recorded images of 13 different floors/scenes within the six buildings. We chose buildings with varied utilities and appearances: the Oculus, New York University Silver Center for Arts and Science, Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, Morton Williams Supermarket, and Metropolitan Museum of Art. These settings represent a broad range of indoor spaces, including shopping malls, teaching buildings, libraries, supermarkets, and museums. Fig. 2 shows the trajectories and example images of certain scenes.</p>

                <p>For each building, we selected one or multiple floors as scenes. For each scene, we fixed the trajectory and captured videos along the same route at different times throughout the year. Fig. 3 shows the time distribution of visits. The videos were recorded from April to July 2022 and from March to April 2023. Therefore, it contains various changes in illumination and appearance. As shown in Fig. 4, we can see image changes at the same location over a year.</p>

                                        Our dataset stands out in two ways. First, NYC-Indoor-VPR images were captured in buildings such as The Oculus and the Bobst Library, which typically have a large flow of pedestrians. We anonymized these pedestrians in the images to reduce their exposure to personally identifiable information. These anonymized images not only enhance data privacy but also allow VPR algorithms to focus more on invariant or environmental features rather than transient features, such as moving people. Second, NYC-Indoor-VPR spans a year and includes images captured in buildings that undergo significant visual changes over time. For instance, goods in the supermarket vary and storefronts in the shopping mall are subject to change. This variability in the dataset allows us to test the performance of the VPR algorithms with fewer invariant features in the images.

                                    <p>
                                        Our dataset includes images in two view directions: front-view and side-view. Front-view images has a view direction that is parallel to the driving/street direction. Front-view images usually have features of roads, shapes of skylines, and textures of the roadside buildings. Contrarily, side-view images has a view direction facing buildings along street. Side view direction is perpendicular to front view direction.

                                        Because our dataset is one-year long, the images taken at the same location have artificial or natural differences. First, Fig. 7 left was taken in October 2016 with sideway constructions and the right was taken in December 2016 after the construction. At some locations, the construction may cover the whole image. Second, different seasons cause different appearances at the same location. Fig. 8 left was taken in summer, July 2016, and the right was taken in winter, January 2017. In this case, the vegetation in Washington Square Park had changed a lot and snow was covering the ground in winter. Furthermore, if the vehicle was moving fast, the images taken by the vehicle will be blurry (Fig. 9). Although two images were taken at the same location, the blurry one will cause more difficulty during VPR.
